In 2009, Mr Ban continued to stress his concerns for global warming at the World Climate Conference in Geneva, and in 2014 he joined demonstrators in the People's Climate March in New York City. He also called together world leaders for the 2014 UN Climate Summit, which served as a preparatory meeting for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n\nMr Ban was also a tenacious advocate for the Millennium Development Goals and their successors, the Sustainable Development Goals.

He set up a mediation support unit, which, together with the Secretary-General's good offices, helped to prevent, manage and resolve tensions, conflicts and crises. Particularly, he took steps to bring accountability for human rights violations through inquiries related to Gaza, Guinea, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, legal processes in Lebanon and Cambodia, and advocated the \"responsibility to protect\".\n\nMr Ban has also sought to strengthen humanitarian response in the aftermath of the megadisasters in Myanmar 2008, in Haiti 2010 and in Pakistan 2010, and mobilised UN support for the countries in democratic transition in North Africa and the Middle East. Mr Ban also led efforts to revive the disarmament agenda and break the deadlock at the Conference on Disarmament and urged renewed attention to nuclear safety and security in the aftermath of the tragedy at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n---\n\n",

Elders \n\n## Desmond Tutu\n\nFormer Archbishop of Cape Town, Nobel Peace Laureate and Chair of The Elders; he was a veteran anti-apartheid activist and peace campaigner who was widely regarded as 'South Africa's moral conscience'.\n\n- Nobel Peace Laureate, 1984\n- Appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, 1986\n- Appointed Chair of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 1994\n- Founding member and Chair of The Elders, 2007-2013\n\"Despite all of the ghastliness in the world, human beings are made for goodness. The ones that are held in high regard are not militarily powerful, nor even economically prosperous. They have a commitment to try and make the world a better place.\" - Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\n\n## Work with The Elders\n\nKnown affectionately as 'Arch' by his fellow Elders, Desmond Tutu helped bring the group together in 2007 and served as its much-loved Chair until he stepped down in May 2013. He continued to support the group as an \"Elder Emeritus\" until his death in 2021.\n\nOne of the world's best known advocates for peace and reconciliation, Archbishop Tutu travelled to Cyprus with the Elders several times to encourage reconciliation between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities; to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories to promote a just and secure Middle East peace; to Côte d'Ivoire, where the Elders encouraged national reconciliation following the post-election violence of early 2011; to Sudan and South Sudan to highlight humanitarian needs and the importance of dialogue between political leaders; In 2014, he joined an Elders delegation to Iran, meeting President Rouhani and key Iranian figures to promote peaceful solutions to conflict and sectarian divisions in the region.\n\nA vigorous champion of youth empowerment, Archbishop Tutu took part in several intergenerational initiatives, including Elders+Youngers and The Elders' intergenerational climate blog series. He also travelled to Ethiopia with The Elders in June 2011, and to India in February 2012, to support communities tackling the harmful traditional practice of child marriage.\n\n## Anti-apartheid archbishop\n\n---\n\n## Page 1\n\nDesmond Tutu began his career as a high school teacher but turned to theology after the 1953 Bantu Education Act enforced racial segregation in all educational institutions in South Africa. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1960, becoming the first black Anglican Dean of Johannesburg in 1975 and the first black General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches four years later. An outspoken critic of the apartheid government, he insisted that racial segregation was against God's will. He soon became well-known internationally for his commitment to non-violence and support for economic sanctions against apartheid South Africa.\n\nDesmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 \"for his role as a unifying leader figure in the non-violent campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa.\" In 1986 he was elected Archbishop of Cape Town, the highest position in the Anglican Church in South Africa. Widely regarded as 'South Africa's moral conscience', he continued to speak out against the apartheid regime and organised many peaceful demonstrations with thousands marching beside him.\n\n# Truth and reconciliation \n\nIn 1994, after the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, Desmond Tutu was appointed Chair of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate apartheid-era crimes. The model he established was based on truth as a foundation for forgiveness and reconciliation and became central in healing South Africa's divided society. Archbishop Tutu believed that: \"without forgiveness there can be no future for a relationship between individuals or within and between nations.\"\n\nTutu retired as Chair of the Commission in 1998 and shared his experience and advice with those undertaking their own truth and reconciliation processes in post-conflict societies, from Northern Ireland to the Solomon Islands.\n\n## Advocate for peace and justice\n\nDespite announcing his retirement from public life in 2010, Desmond Tutu continued to stand up for those who are poor and oppressed, to raise awareness of global crises such as the AIDS pandemic and climate change, and to advance peace and reconciliation worldwide. Alongside his wife, Leah, Archbishop Tutu continued to work through the Desmond \\& Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation with the objective of promoting peace-building through conflict resolution, fostering reconciliation and cultivating accountable servant leadership until his death in 2021.\n\nArchbishop Tutu's ability to convey difficult messages with clarity, compassion and conviviality made him one of the most loved and respected activists of our time. As his great friend Nelson Mandela said of Tutu, he was \"sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour.\"\n\n---\n\n",

President Sirleaf helped rebuild the healthcare system through new clinics, schools and training centres.\n\nFollowing the Ebola epidemic, she launched a national community health assistance programme to serve more than 4000 communities in the most remote areas, recognising that primary healthcare providers are best positioned to spot the early signs of outbreaks.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has taken up the position as Co-chair of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR), an independent body tasked with providing an evidence-based path for the future to ensure that countries and institutions can effectively address health threats, and she continues to promote vaccine equity and a fair distribution of vaccines across the globe.\n\n---\n\n",

He has joined several Elders' delegations to promote human rights and security and to address geopolitical issues including to China, Ethiopia, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States and at multilateral fora including the UN General Assembly and the Munich Security Conference.\n\nPresident Zedillo has met with a number of world leaders as a member of The Elders including President Xi Jinping in 2019; HRH King Salman bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia in 2018; President Joko Widowo of Indonesia in 2017; President Vladimir Putin in 2015; and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran in 2014.\n\n---\n\n## Page 1\n\nPresident Zedillo has also met UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the UN Security Council on several occasions to discuss major global threats facing the international community and the Security Council's special mandate to uphold global peace and security.\n\n# A bold reformer in Mexico \n\nErnesto Zedillo began his career as an economist at the Central Bank of Mexico, before being appointed Budget Secretary in Mexico's federal government in 1988. He became Education Secretary in 1992 and launched immediate, sweeping reforms of the national basic education system.\n\nElected President of Mexico in 1994, he successfully enacted bold reforms to address the financial and economic crisis. From 1996 to 2000, Mexico experienced five years of the highest GDP growth rates in the country's recent history. At the same time, his government made strong commitments to social justice by increasing its spending on social programmes.\n\nHis administration launched PROGRESA: the first conditional cash transfer programme to fight extreme poverty. As part of this, poor families received financial support on the condition that children attend school and receive preventative medical care. The initiative reached millions of families and has since been replicated in more than 40 countries throughout the world.\n\nAs President, Ernesto Zedillo also undertook profound democratic reforms - transparency and independence of the electoral institution, fair campaign financing and an electoral tribunal within the judiciary to solve electoral controversies - paving the way for a robust multi-party democracy in Mexico. He pursued and achieved full independence for the Mexican Federal Judiciary and appointed a leader of the opposition as Attorney General of the Nation.\n\n## Confronting global challenges\n\nSince leaving office, President Zedillo has worked to find solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing the global community.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, Ernesto Zedillo joined the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR), an independent body tasked with providing an evidence-based path for the future to ensure that countries and institutions can effectively address health threats, co-chaired by his fellow Elder Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nPresident Zedillo serves on the Global Commission on Drug Policy, co-founded by Elder Emeritus Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which calls for a vast rethinking of the 'global war on drugs' debate and proposes better regulation to end the criminalisation and marginalisation of drug users. He co-chaired the Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy and, based on work at the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, published the edited volume Rethinking the War on Drugs through the US-Mexico Prism in 2012.\n\n---\n\n## Page 2\n\nHis work on nuclear non-proliferation includes serving on the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which released its final report, Eliminating Nuclear Threats: A Practical Agenda for Global Policymakers in 2009. In 2007, he was appointed to chair a commission to recommend the future course of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN body promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\nHe has also worked on a number of initiatives focused on climate change mitigation and, in 2008, published the edited volume Global Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto.\n\n# Championing development \n\nSince 2009, Ernesto Zedillo has been the Director of the Center for the Study of Globalization at Yale University where he teaches courses on trade theory and policy, globalisation and the economic evolution and challenges of the Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008, President Zedillo was a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor alongside fellow Elders Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Mary Robinson. The Commission was the first global initiative to focus on the link between exclusion, poverty and the law and its findings became an integral part of the work of UNDP.\n\nFurthermore, he has participated in numerous other initiatives aimed at improving the world's ability to design and implement development policy, notably as:\n\n- Vice-Chair of the Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and Security, 2010-2012\n- Chair of the High-Level Commission on Modernisation of World Bank Group Governance, which published its recommendations in 2009\n- Chair of the Global Development Network, an organisation working to support researchers and institutions from developing countries, 2005-2011\n- Chair of the UN High-Level Panel on Financing.\n\n---\n\n",

He became Education Secretary in 1992 and launched immediate, sweeping reforms of the national basic education system.\n\nElected President of Mexico in 1994, he successfully enacted bold reforms to address the financial and economic crisis. From 1996 to 2000, Mexico experienced five years of the highest GDP growth rates in the country's recent history. At the same time, his government made strong commitments to social justice by increasing its spending on social programmes.\n\nHis administration launched PROGRESA: the first conditional cash transfer programme to fight extreme poverty. As part of this, poor families received financial support on the condition that children attend school and receive preventative medical care. The initiative reached millions of families and has since been replicated in more than 40 countries throughout the world.\n\nAs President, Ernesto Zedillo also undertook profound democratic reforms - transparency and independence of the electoral institution, fair campaign financing and an electoral tribunal within the judiciary to solve electoral controversies - paving the way for a robust multi-party democracy in Mexico. He pursued and achieved full independence for the Mexican Federal Judiciary and appointed a leader of the opposition as Attorney General of the Nation.\n\n## Confronting global challenges\n\nSince leaving office, President Zedillo has worked to find solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing the global community.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, Ernesto Zedillo joined the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR), an independent body tasked with providing an evidence-based path for the future to ensure that countries and institutions can effectively address health threats, co-chaired by his fellow Elder Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nPresident Zedillo serves on the Global Commission on Drug Policy, co-founded by Elder Emeritus Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which calls for a vast rethinking of the 'global war on drugs' debate and proposes better regulation to end the criminalisation and marginalisation of drug users. He co-chaired the Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy and, based on work at the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, published the edited volume Rethinking the War on Drugs through the US-Mexico Prism in 2012.",

In 2007, he was appointed to chair a commission to recommend the future course of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN body promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\nHe has also worked on a number of initiatives focused on climate change mitigation and, in 2008, published the edited volume Global Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto.\n\n# Championing development \n\nSince 2009, Ernesto Zedillo has been the Director of the Center for the Study of Globalization at Yale University where he teaches courses on trade theory and policy, globalisation and the economic evolution and challenges of the Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008, President Zedillo was a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor alongside fellow Elders Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Mary Robinson. The Commission was the first global initiative to focus on the link between exclusion, poverty and the law and its findings became an integral part of the work of UNDP.\n\nFurthermore, he has participated in numerous other initiatives aimed at improving the world's ability to design and implement development policy, notably as:\n\n- Vice-Chair of the Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and Security, 2010-2012\n- Chair of the High-Level Commission on Modernisation of World Bank Group Governance, which published its recommendations in 2009\n- Chair of the Global Development Network, an organisation working to support researchers and institutions from developing countries, 2005-2011\n- Chair of the UN High-Level Panel on Financing.",

Together with The Elders she has travelled to Myanmar, France, Thailand, Argentina, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and several visits to the US and the UN in New York.\n\nShe has participated in world conferences - from the Munich Security Conference in 2017 to the Women Deliver Conference in Denmark in 2016 - and has spoken at numerous high-level events about ensuring access to justice, achieving gender equality and the importance of civil society as well as the need for an effective multilateral institutional framework that respects human rights.\n\nHina Jilani is especially passionate about women and girls' rights and women's role in justice and peace-making, defending human rights defenders and the fair treatment and protection of refugees.\n\n---\n\n## Page 1\n\n# Pioneering lawyer and activist \n\nA renowned lawyer and civil society activist, Hina Jilani has dedicated her life to fighting for human rights and democracy in Pakistan and around the world.\n\"We were growing up in an environment in which we saw injustices happen and our home taught us never to turn away when we saw it,\" Ms Jilani says about her upbringing with a father who spent long spells in prison for criticising Pakistan's military dictatorship.

Yet, despite repeated threats and intimidation, she continues to live in Lahore, working tirelessly to mobilise civil society and promote human rights.\n\n## International human rights defender\n\nHina Jilani was one of the founders of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Established in 1986, the Commission has branches throughout the country and is today the most important national body for the monitoring of rights violations.\n\nIn 2000 she became the first Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders, and for the next eight years worked to empower and protect rights defenders worldwide. During her tenure she identified common themes in the treatment of human rights defenders, including the culture of impunity; intimidation and lack of security; restrictions on\n\n---\n\n## Page 2\n\nfreedom of assembly, expression, and association; and death threats against defenders who seek justice for past crimes.\n\nMs Jilani has also served as:\n\n- Member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, appointed by the United Nations Security Council, 2004\n- Member of the Eminent Jurists Panel on Human Rights and Counter Terrorism appointed by the International Commission of Jurists, 2006-2008\n- Member of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on Gaza, 2009\n\nIn July 2013 she was elected to join the International Commission of Jurists.

In its report issued in April 2021, the Commission said police violence against African-Americans in the US amounted to \"crimes against humanity\".\n\n---\n\n",

His successor and fellow Elder Ban Ki-moon said: \"Kofi Annan was a committed humanitarian and monumental leader who leaves behind him a remarkable and enduring legacy,\" and UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasised how Mr Annan was a guiding force for good: \"In these turbulent and trying times, his legacy as a global champion for peace will remain a true inspiration for us all.\"\n\n# $7^{\\text {th }}$ Secretary-General of the United Nations \n\nKofi Annan was the $7^{\\text {th }}$ Secretary-General of the United Nations and the first to emerge from the ranks of UN staff.

In Kenya, in early 2008, he led the African Union's Panel of Eminent African Personalities to mediate a peaceful resolution to the post-election violence. Between February and August 2012, he served as the UN/Arab League Joint Special Envoy on the Syrian crisis.\n\nIn September 2016, Mr Annan was appointed Chair of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State in Myanmar, tasked with supporting and advising the Government of Myanmar in resolving the conflict in Rakhine State and improving the welfare of all people living there.\n\n# Advocate for Africa \n\nSince leaving the United Nations, Kofi Annan continued to advocate for better policies to meet the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, particularly in Africa.\n\nIn 2007 he established the Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer, more secure world.
